# Autonomous_projects

This repository is created for establishing my projects on autonomous mobility. As an autonomous perception engineer, I admire works with camera, lidar and radar data processing and creating better and safer mobility for autonomous driving. I will be posting projects on Image processing, Pixel-cloud fusion, Object Detection using Deep Neural Networks, etc. Stay tuned.
